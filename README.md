## Introduction
The project was created as part of the Dare IT course, during which I learned how to write automated tests using the Robot Framework and Selenium Library.
The tests were performed in the Google Chrome browser using chromedriver.

## Getting started
1. Instal [Python](https://www.python.org/), [Robot Framework](https://robotframework.org/) and [Sellenium Library](https://github.com/robotframework/SeleniumLibrary).
2. Clone repository to your local environment.
3. Add the chromedriver.exe file to the project.

## Run tests
To run tests write in console: robot name_of_the_file_with_test.robot
